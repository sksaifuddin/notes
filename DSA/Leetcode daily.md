This is the notes for my leetcode daily problems

## Day 5 - Jan 5 - [2381. Shifting Letters II](https://leetcode.com/problems/shifting-letters-ii/)

### Brute force solution - No
#### Thoughts
Although I came up with logic for brute force but I was not able to do the shifting of characters forward and backward. 

### Optimized Solution

#### Thoughts
The optimized solution uses **line sweep algorithm**. The algorithm looked simple but I still lack understanding of the problem. Need to learn about it. The character shifting was still tough for me.
