_Smells are certain structures in the code that suggest (sometimes they scream for) the possibility of refactoring. - Kent Beck

Types of smells:
1. Architectural smells (Scope is at the component level)
2. Implementation smells (Scope is limited to a method or code block)
3. Design smells (Attributes of a class or a set of attributes)
4. Test smells
5. Performance smells
and many more......
