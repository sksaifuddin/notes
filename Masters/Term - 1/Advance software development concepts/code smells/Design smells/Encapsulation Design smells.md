Hiding implementation details

### 1. Deficient Encapsulation:
- unrestricted access

This design smell occurs when the declared accessibility of one or more members of an abstraction is more permissive than actually required. (Lot of public properties ).

How to remember: encapsulation is all about hiding details, so deficient means less, which mean we are showing properties to outside world, which can be done only by declaring it as public.
