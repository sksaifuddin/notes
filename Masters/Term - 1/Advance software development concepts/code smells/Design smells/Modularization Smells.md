Modularization: The activity of dividing a product or system into logical structures called modules.

### 1. Insufficient modularization:

This smell arises when an abstraction exists that has not been completely decomposed  and a further decomposition could reduce its size, implementation complexity, or both.

### 2. Hub like modularization:

This smell arised when an abstraction has dependencies with a large number of other abstractions
