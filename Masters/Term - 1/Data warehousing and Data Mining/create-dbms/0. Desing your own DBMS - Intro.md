So we've been given with a very interesting assginment to design and code our own mini DBMS like mysql.

Since this is a very interesting problem I will be studying it and taking the notes of my thought process and design so that I can use it later or may be just write a blog about it.

STEPS:

- [ ] 1. Understand the architecture of mysql or any other db(if mysql is difficult)
- [ ] 2. Plan all the classes and high level design of the project
- [ ] 3. implementation
	- [ ] Authentication and signup
	- [ ] Persistence storage
	- [ ] Query
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Report creation
