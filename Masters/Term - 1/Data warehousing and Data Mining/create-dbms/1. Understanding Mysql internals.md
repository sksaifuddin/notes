Currently I have no idea how a DBMS and its internal structure works. The best DBMS I heard of is mysql, so I decided to learn more about mysql internal components and how its data engine works.
For now I will only explore parts enough to complete my assignments but I would definitely would like to go deeper in this topics and keep evolving notes about internal working of DBMS.

NOTE: Target is not to imitate the architecture of mysql, but to create my own architecture, I want to learn about internal working just to know components of a DBMS. Also it sounds super cool and I love finding out how things work under the hood.

Okay... I tried to understand a little bit about mysql internal structure and it turns out I can't understand anything ðŸ˜‚. I tried reading its manual and other articles; mysql is too big and too complicated to understand in such a small amount of time. I've decided to understand something smaller like sqlite.

Sqlite has follow overview:

You can read more about all these components from here: https://www.sqlite.org/arch.html
The main components and ideas which i can pick from here to develop a minimal DBMS for assignment is Tokenizer, parser. - for me these sounds like part of compiler. Lets read more about parsers and tokenizer from compilers concepts, this will help to me build a good minimal query compiler for the assignment.

## Conclusion:
The project structure which I am currently thinking is:
- compiler: All classes and code for taking the query from input and getting the data from the file
	- tokenizer
	- parser
	- code generator (lets see if we will need this)
- core: all the core code of the project for file manipulation, storing data in files, delimiter handling etc.
- frontend: all code for taking the input from user and returning the result back.
